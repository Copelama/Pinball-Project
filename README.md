# Pinball-Project
For this project, I will be creating a part of a bigger pinball machine project for ECE 484. The theme of the pinball machine is soccer, specifically a free kick for the Celtics soccer team.
For the jackpot, the player is expected to score a goal at the back of the machine while having to dodge other stationary players and a moving "goalie" that is inside the goal. The ball will be then returned 
to the ball return and they will begin their free game as per the rules of the jackpot.
