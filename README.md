# Pinball-Project
For this project, I will be creating a part of a bigger pinball machine project for ECE 484. The theme of the pinball machine is soccer, specifically a free kick for the Celtics soccer team.
For the jackpot, the player is expected to score a goal at the back of the machine while having to dodge other stationary players and a moving "goalie" that is inside the goal. The ball will be then returned 
to the ball return and they will begin their free game as per the rules of the jackpot. This aspect of the build will have two key components: the hardware side and the software side. The hardware component will include the actuators that will move the goalie back and forth, the ball return from the goal, the "players" blocking the goal, and all related sensors that will indict when the ball has hit or entered a given area. The software side will include the movement of the goalie and getting the sensors to communicate to the master microprocessor for score keeping, jackpot, and audio cues based on where the ball hits/goes.
